# Doorman - Apartment Door Edition

This code runs on an Arduino-compatible ESP8266-based board. Using a stepper motor and some 3D printed parts, it is intended to lock and unlock my apartment door for me.

It is much more finnicky than the one controlling the main apartment building door, as that requires no moving parts. As such, it is currently not working IRL.
